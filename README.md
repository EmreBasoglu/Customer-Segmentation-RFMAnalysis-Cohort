Customer Segmentation & RFM Analysis

This project aims to understand and segment customer behavior using customer segmentation and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. The project provides insights to develop better marketing strategies by revealing the characteristics of various customer groups.

In this project, RFM analysis was applied to perform customer segmentation. RFM analysis uses three basic metrics to better understand customer relationships:

Recency (Last Shopping Time): The time elapsed since the customer's last purchase.

Frequency (Frequency): The number of purchases made in a certain time period.

Monetary (Financial): The total spending of the customer in a certain time period.

Using these metrics, customers were divided into various segments and the differences between these segments were analyzed.

Results
The analysis reveals the characteristics of each segment by dividing customers into various segments. The results can be used to develop targeted marketing strategies. The segments obtained as a result of RFM analysis provide important insights to better understand customer behavior and improve customer relationships.
